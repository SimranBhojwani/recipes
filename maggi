This is not as easy as it looks like. A bit tedious to make, this is a desi variant of Minestrone basically. Chop carrots, celery, onions and vegetable stock. Fry the veggies in regular oil. Add vegetable stock, and simmer till half in volume. Add the Maggi and the Masala. Cook till the Maggi is done. Om nom nom!
